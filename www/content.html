<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The appendix of Lawson et al. (2017) provides a brief introduction
  to the calculations performed by the freesortphi package (phi.intra,
  phi.inter, and Monte Carlo estimation of their respective chance
  values). 
<h1>Installation</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of R from <a href =
"https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.

  <li>(optional but recommended for those new to R) Install <a href =
  "https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>

  <li>Install catlearn:
  <ul> 
     <li><i>Latest version</i>: From within R,
     type: <p>install.packages('freesortphi',
     repos='http://R-Forge.R-project.org') <p><b>NOTE</b>: In order to
     install the unstable version on a Mac or a Linux machine, you
     may need to install additional software for building R packages
     from source. These are available on CRAN, in the same place you
     download R. Windows users do not need to worry about this.
  </ul> 
</ol>

  functions. Load the package using <b>library(freesortphi)</b> and then
